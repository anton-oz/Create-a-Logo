# SVG Logo Generator

## Description


I built this app so that I could easily generate a simple logo for personal projects that I make. It simplifies the process of creating an SVG logo. Instead of writing out the code for the SVG file every time you need a simple logo, you can respond to four prompts and a SVG logo is generated for you. After finishing this project I feel much more confident using classes, and exporting/importing code between JS files.

## Installation

Navigate to the directory with the vscode terminal and enter ```npm i``` to install the neccesary packages for the app to function. 

## Usage

Stay in the same directory when you installed the dependencies and enter ```npm run test``` to ensure that the app is running properly. To generate a logo, enter ```node index.js```, respond to the prompts and a logo.svg file will be created in the examples folder.
